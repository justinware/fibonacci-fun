# Fibonacci Fun

This Kata is designed to show various aspects of programming (and testing) with TypeScript, from user input processing, business logic & data manipulation, component interaction, modularity, to async operations and data streaming.

The console application takes input from the user in a REPL, performs various actions on that input and also displays input statistics to the user on a timer with a specified interval.

How to the use the program is described in the text once it starts up.
